# Bug Bounty Custom Tooling
This was tooling from early in my bug bounty days! 
Use it if you want it, no promises about code quality (these were some of my first scripts so it's not great). I highly encourage you to write your own scripts, just because that helps build skills, even if the first few aren't great. Some of these scripts are just automations of pre-existing outside tooling-based manual workflows, while others are standalone automations for typically annoyingly manual parts of the bug bounty process. 

### Maintenance
I don't use any of this tooling in bug bounty anymore (mostly for quality reasons), so it's not actively maintained. Apologies if any libraries don't exist or newer best practices are not followed.
