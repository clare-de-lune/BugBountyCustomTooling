# Bug Bounty Custom Tooling
This was custom tooling from early in my bug bounty days! 
Use it if you want it, no promises about code quality (these were some of my first scripts so it's not great).


### Maintenance
I don't use any of this tooling in bug bounty anymore (mostly for quality reasons), so it's not actively maintained. Apologies if any libraries don't exist or newer best practices are not followed.
